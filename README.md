# CCalculator Basic
### A simpler version of CCalculator

## Functionalities
- Supports 5 operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation)
- Delete function
- Clear function
- Use the result feature
- Fully operable via keyboard input
- Fully operable via mouse input

#### Since this is a simplified version of CCalculator (my advanced CCalculator project), it can only perform operations on two numbers, such as (2 + 2), as it utilizes the switch statement provided by the language itself.

## How to Use

You need a compiler to run the calculator.

[You can check out this tutorial on how to compile C programs](https://jestery.kesug.com/how-to-compile-c-programs/).

Also, you need to install the GTK library since the program uses GTK for the graphical user interface.
